OpenAssets is a repository of freely available, open source assets. 

These assets will be included in the base server and client, where acceptable. 

OpenAssets will require the same meta-data tagging as licensed assets.
A ProtOasis keypair should be generated, so that OpenAssets fall in line with licensing control authority system.
(This may be in contrary to statements in the project readme - I'm a bit braindead atm, please update!)

**
More Info (for lack of better place atm):
The Licensing Control Authority system will use a secured key-pair to determine the useage rights of assets per server.
There will be three types of private keys:
ProtOasis general private key, which is set by the developers. The public key will be published for all asset creators to use. 
ProtOasis Server generic private key, set by the server operator for custom private assets.
ProtOasis Asset private key, set by the asset creator, stored securely by Expo and loaded into Station upon purchase. Requires ProtOasis account.
